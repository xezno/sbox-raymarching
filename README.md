# s&box raymarching demo

This is a basic work-in-progress 90s-style raymarching demo / proof-of-concept.

## Goals

Here's what I want to eventually achieve with this (none of this is implemented yet):

- Voxel rendering
- Physically-based sky rendering
- Virtually infinite\* render distance *(\*not actually infinite, but far enough that world curvature takes shape)*
- Procedurally generated flora - trees, rocks, etc.
